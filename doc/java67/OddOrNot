1. Write a program in Java to check if a number is even or odd in Java? (input 2 output true, input 3 : output false)
A number is called even if it is completely divisible by two and odd if it’s not completely divisible by two. 
For example number 4 is even number because when you do 4/2 , remainder is 0 which means 4 is completely divisible by 2. 
On the other hand 5 is odd number because 5/2 will result in remainder as 1.
